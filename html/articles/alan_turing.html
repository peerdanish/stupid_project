	    <ul>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1912: </span>Alan Mathison Turing was born to Julius Mathison and Ethel Sara on June 23, 1912, in Paddington, London. Julius was employed with the 'Indian Civil Service', and with his wife, he had another son, John.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1926: </span>He pursued his elementary education from 'St Michael's', later studying at the 'Sherborne School' in Dorset, starting from 1926.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1931: </span>In 1931, he began attending 'King's College', at the 'University of Cambridge', graduating in mathematics three years later with top scores.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1935: </span>He began pursuing a fellowship from 'King's College' in 1935, during which he published the paper, 'On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem'.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1939: </span>In December, 1939, he developed a decrypting technique using statistical analysis, and called it the 'Banburismus'. The 'Banburismus' had the potential to decipher the 'Enigma' codes, which were more complex than those used by other warring countries.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1940: </span>The first bombe began functioning in Bletchley Park, on March 18, 1940, and it was built to electrically arrive at logical conclusions about what the Enigma indicators meant.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1942: </span>In 1942, the brilliant mathematician went to the United States to study the methods of breaking the 'Naval Enigma' codes being employed by logicians at the 'Computing Machine Laboratory', in Dayton, Ohio.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1948: </span>In 1948, he also stated the 'LU decomposition method', a pioneering technique which is presently used to solve matrices.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1950: </span>Around the same time, he produced a research paper describing his conception of computer that could hold pre-fed programs. A crude and incomplete model of the 'ACE' was built for testing purposes in 1950, when the illustrious mathematician was in Cambridge.</li>
	   
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1954: </span>On June 8, 1954, Alan was found poisoned at home, and after the autopsy, it was concluded that he had taken his own life by consuming large quantities of potassium cyanide.</li
