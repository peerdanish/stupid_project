	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1901: </span>Most of Einstein’s strikingly remarkable works came during this period. He utilized his free time by engaging himself in scientific research. In 1901, he published the paper ‘Folgerungen aus den Kapillaritat Erscheinungen’ (Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena) in the most prominent scientific journal, Annalen der Physik.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1903 : </span>It was in 1903 that Einstein became a permanent officer therein. His job involved evaluating patent applications for electromagnetic devices.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1905: </span>Four years thence, in 1905, he completed his thesis by presenting a dissertation which was entitled “A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions”. For the same, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. However, the degree was just the beginning of the many more things that were waiting to come up.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1908: </span>In 1908, he was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Bern. However, Einstein quit this position as well as the one he was holding at the patent office to take up the profile of physics docent at the University of Zurich.</li>

	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1916: </span>Two years thence in 1916, Einstein was appointed as the president of the German Physical Society, a position he held for two years. During this time, Einstein also attained membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</li>

			<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1936: </span>In 1936, he was awarded the Franklin Institute's Franklin Medal for his extensive work on relativity and the photo-electric effect.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1955: </span>Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding, which was caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm on April 17, 1955. Although Dr. Rudolph Nissen had reinforced the same surgically in 1948, the problem reappeared. He was admitted to the Princeton Hospital.</li>
