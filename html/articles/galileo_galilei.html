	    <ul>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1564: </span>Born the son of a famed lutenist and musical theorist, Vincenzo Galilei, Galileo and his brother Michelangelo both became accomplished lutenists themselves. However, the family struggles with financial difficulties, particularly because they support the dowries for Galileo's sisters.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1581: </span>Galileo took to studying at the University of Pisa for a degree in medical.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1979: </span>In the late 1970s he began working as an independent consultant and worked for many companies, including CERN where he worked from June to December 1980 as a consultant software engineer.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1586: </span>Galileo publishes a book on the hydrostatic balance. </li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1588: </span>Galileo acquires a position as an art instructor at the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence. While in the position, he starts a lifelong friendship with the painter Cigoli.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1589: </span>Galileo is appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa, for 160 scudi per year. While at Pisa he supposedly demonstrates his conclusions on motion by dropping weights from the Tower of Pisa, although this has never been verified.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1613: </span>In December 1613, Galileo forwards the theory that the ocean tides speed up and slow down according to the rotation of the Earth on its axis and its revolution around the sun, which he says supports the Copernican theory that the Earth goes around the sun. The Catholic Church sees this as a direct challenge to its authority, as it advocates the geocentric theory that the Earth is at the center of the solar system.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1633: </span>Galileo is put on trial by the Inquisition on April 12, 1622, until April 30. He is forced to recant his position on heliocentricism, but he is still sentenced to house arrest, and his work, Dialogue, is banned. Though he is eventually allowed to return to his home near Florence, he stays under house arrest the rest of his life.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1638: </span>While under house arrest, Galileo continues his work. In July 1638 he publishes what is highly regarded as his best work, Two New Sciences, which introduce the studies kinematics and strength of materials. It has to be published in Holland to avoid censorship. The strength of this work often earns him the title "the father of modern physics."</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1642: </span>After receiving continuous visitors nearly to the day of his death, Galileo dies on January 8, 1642. The Pope initially refuses the request that he be interred next to his ancestors in the Basilica of Santa Croce, but eventually his remains are moved to the main body of the Basilica.</li>
