	 <div id="timeline">
	    <ul>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1643: </span>Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, in Woolsthorpe Manor, England, to Hannah Ayscough and Isaac Newton. His father died three months prior to his birth. Hannah remarried Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving the three-year old Newton under the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1661: </span>Newton attained his preliminary education from The King’s School in Grantham, where he excelled and achieved the top-rank. He then enrolled himself as a sizar at the Trinity College, Cambridge in 1661.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1665 : </span>A plague epidemic of 1665 forced the shutdown of the college for two years, which Newton spent at his home in Woolsthorpe. However, he did not let go of his studies and continued the same privately.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1666: </span>Newton contributed heavily to the field of mathematics, distinctly advancing every branch of the subject then studied. His work on fluxions or calculus was featured in the manuscript of 1666, which was later published with his mathematical papers.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1667 : </span>He returned to Cambridge in 1667 as a Fellow of Trinity. However, the same required him to become an ordained priest, something which he detested from due to his unconventional views.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1672: </span>Newton came up with his first published work on lights, optics and color titled ‘Opticks: A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light’. His work, however, did not please everyone at the Royal Society, including Robert Hooke with whom he shared an unpleasant relationship all through.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1679: </span>Unable to take the criticism well and denying the fact that his work had any shortcomings, Newton suffered from a nervous breakdown which further escalated after the death of his mother in 1679.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1687: </span>Encouraged to work out the problem mathematically and offered remuneration for the same, Newton began to work on his theory of mechanics and gravitation and came up with his first book on the subject, titled ‘Philosophiae, Natrualis, Principia Mathematica’ in 1687.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1696: </span>In 1696, Newton was appointed to the position of Warden of the Mint. Acquiring the title, he moved to London to attain this long-desired governmental position. No longer than in 1699, he was promoted to the position of Master of the Mint. Holding the profile until his death, Newton worked on reforming the status of currency and punishing clippers and counterfeiters. He even moved the currency from silver to gold standard.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1727: </span>Newton breathed his last on March 31, 1727, in his sleep after experiencing severe pain in his abdomen. He was buried at Westminister Abbey. Posthumously, Newton was adjudged as the greatest scientist or genius who ever lived. He was even compared to the likes of Aristotle, Plato and Galileo.</li>
