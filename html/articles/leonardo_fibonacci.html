	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1170–75: </span>The exact date of Fibonacci’s birth is not known. It is believed he was born sometime around 1170–75 in Pisa. His father Guglielmo Bonacci was a wealthy Italian merchant who directed a trading post in North Africa. According to some sources, his father also served as the consul for Pisa.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1200: </span>The young mathematician was eager to introduce the Hindu-Arabic numerical system in Europe. Upon his return to Pisa around the year 1200, he wrote a number of texts on mathematics which played an important role in reviving ancient mathematical skills. He also produced several works drawing upon his own experiences and knowledge.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1979: </span>In the late 1970s he began working as an independent consultant and worked for many companies, including CERN where he worked from June to December 1980 as a consultant software engineer.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1202: </span>In 1202, he completed ‘Liber Abaci’ which was among the first Western books to describe Hindu-Arabic numbers traditionally described as "Arabic Numerals". At that time, Hindu-Arabic numerals were known to only a few European intellectuals through translations of the writings of the 9th century Arab mathematician al-Khwārizmī. Fibonacci helped to popularize the concept in the European world. His work gained fame quickly, and soon many copies of the work were made.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1225: </span>The emperor interacted with Fibonacci and the mathematician corresponded with Frederick and his scholars for several years. He collaborated with the scholars to work on mathematical problems, and presented the solutions to problems posed by Johannes of Palermo, in his work ‘Flos’ (1225). He dedicated his ‘Liber quadratorum’ (Book of Square Numbers) to Frederick.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1240–50: </span>The details regarding his death are also obscure. It is generally believed he died around 1240–50.</li>
