	    <ul>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1883: </span>Since a young age, she took to following the footsteps of her father and showed keen interest in mathematics and physics. After attaining her preliminary education from J. Sikorska, she enrolled herself in the gymnasium for girls. She graduated with a gold medal in 1883.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1891: </span>In 1891, she moved to France and enrolled herself at the Sorbonne University. It was there that she came to be known as Marie. With meagre financial aid, she took to tutoring in the evening to earn money for survival.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1893: </span>In 1893, she was awarded a master’s degree in physics, while she attained master’s degree in mathematics the following year. She started her scientific career by investigating the different type of steel and their magnetic properties.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1896: </span>In 1896, Henri Becquerel’s discovery of uranium salts emitting rays deeply inspired and interested her and led to taking the work a little further. She employed electrometer to find out that the rays remained constant, irrespective of the condition or form of uranium.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1898: </span>In 1898, while working on the mineral pitchblende, they discovered a new element which was also radioactive. They named it ‘polonium’, after Poland. Later the same year, they found out yet another element that they named ‘radium’. It was during this time that they coined the term, ‘radioactivity’.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1902: </span>To eliminate any doubts about their discovery, the two undertook the ardent task of taking out polonium and radium in their pure form, from the mineral pitchblende. In 1902, they finally succeeded in separating out radium salt by differential crystallization.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1906: </span>In 1906, following the death of Pierre, Sorbonne University offered her his chair of physics and professorship which she accepted with an aim to set up a world-class laboratory.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1910: </span>In 1910, she successfully isolated radium and defined an international standard for radioactive emissions which eventually was named after her surname.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1911: </span>In 1911, she was bestowed with her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1930: </span>In 1930, she was appointed as the member of the International Atomic Weights Committee.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1934: </span>Marie breathed her last on July 4, 1934, at the Sancellemoz Sanatorium in Passy, in Haute-Savoie, suffering from aplastic anemia due to prolonged exposure to radiation.</li>
