	    <ul>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1965: </span>From a very young age, he was a music lover. Initially starting as a backup musician, he soon found his way as a lead singer in the family band, the Jackson 5.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1967: </span>The Jackson 5 started touring Midwest, extensively performing at black clubs. In 1967, they released their first single, ‘Big Boy’ with Steeltown record label but the same failed to interest the audience.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1968: </span>In 1968, they signed a contract with Motown Records, which required them to relocate to Los Angeles. Following year, they came up with their first album, ‘Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5’. Its first single, ‘I Want You Back’ was a chartbuster and was followed by bestsellers ‘ABC’, ‘The Love You Save’, and ‘I'll Be There’, each of which peaked at No 1 on Billboard Hot 100.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1975: </span>The Jackson 5 band withdrew its association with Motown Records in 1975. The same year, they tied up with Epic Records under a new name ‘the Jacksons’.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1984: </span>From 1976 to 1984, the band toured internationally and released six new albums. He became a leading songwriter for the group, writing numerous hits one after the other.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1979: </span>Meanwhile, he launched his solo album in association with Quincy Jones, ‘Off the Wall’ in 1979. The album was a tremendous hit and the first ever to generate four U.S. top 10 hits. It peaked at the number three on the Billboard 200 and eventually sold over 20 million copies worldwide.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1982: </span>The desire to make a bigger impact than what ‘Off the Wall’ made, led to the 1982 release of the album ‘Thriller’. A grand blockbuster, the album broke all records to become the best-selling album of all time worldwide. It topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of 200 for 80 weeks at a stretch. The album sold 65 million copies and achieved a Double Diamond status in the US.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1983: </span>In 1983, he reunited with his brothers for a live performance. It was there that he showed his signature dance style, the moonwalk, which became an epic. Magic was created on stage as he sung the chartbuster ‘Billie Jean’ whilst performing the moonwalk.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1988: </span>In 1988, the exemplary pop star released his autobiography titled Moonwalk. The book duplicated the success of his music albums by selling about 200, 000 copies and making it to the New York Times best-seller list.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1993: </span>In 1993, he performed at several significant events, including Super Bowl XXVII. The same year, he was charged of molestation but since there were no proofs to support the allegation, the charges were withdrawn.</li>

	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">2001: </span>In October 2001, he released the album, Invincible. This was his last full-length album. Though the album gained decent success, it was his eccentric and disoriented behaviour that caught the headlines..</li>
