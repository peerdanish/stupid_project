	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1942: </span>Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, to Frank and Isobel Hawking. His father was a medical researcher. He belonged to a family of well educated people. His mother was one of the first female students to have graduated from the Oxford University.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1968: </span>Hawking became a member of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge in 1968 and the discoveries of cosmologist, Roger Penrose, on 'Black Hole' really fascinated him as he himself was working on the phenomena that was responsible for the origin of the Universe.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1970: </span>In 1970, Hawking discovered the 'Second Law of Black Hole Dynamics.' According to it the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller. Along with James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of 'Black Hole Mechanics.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1973: </span>Hawking visited Moscow in 1973 and his discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky helped him to come up with ‘Hawking Radiation.' The following year, he became a 'Fellow of the Royal Society.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1975: </span>He started to get more recognition for his research and discoveries through his print and TV interviews, and in 1975, he was awarded the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, followed by the Dannie Heineman Prize and the Maxwell Prize.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1977: </span>Hawking was then appointed as a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977 and received the 'Albert Einstein Medal' and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1979: </span>He gradually started losing control over his speech and it became increasing difficult to understand him but that this did not stop him from getting appointed as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the Cambridge University in 1979.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1982: </span>In 1982, Hawking and Gary Gibbons organized a Nuffield Workshop on the topic ‘The Very Early Universe’ at Cambridge University, which focused principally on the cosmological inflation theory.</li>
	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1985: </span>In 1985, he lost his voice after a tracheotomy. As a result of this, he required 24-hour care.

	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">1993: </span>In 1993, he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons, and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and his series of lectures were published as ‘The Nature of Space and Time</li>

	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">2001: </span>He wrote an easy to read book on cosmology in 2001, ‘The Universe in Nutshell’, which was followed by, ‘A Briefer History of Time (2005), ‘God Created the Integers (2006)’, ‘God’s Secret Key to the Universe (2007)’, etc.</li>

	    	<li class="timeline_detail"><span class="year">2009: </span>Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009, owing to University rules and regulations. He continued to work as a director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.</li>
